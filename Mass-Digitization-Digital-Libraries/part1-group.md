# Exploring HathiTrust: Digitization in Practice

## Finding the African American Periodical Poetry

### Search strategies used
- Searched by magazine title (e.g., *The Crisis*, *Opportunity*, *Black Opals*) rather than poem title  
- Used publication year from the Hennessey dataset to narrow results  
- Tried author names, but this was not always effective  
- Manually browsed volumes and issues when keyword searches failed  

### Were we able to find all issues?
- We were able to find some, but not all, of the exact magazine issues  
- In several cases, we found the correct magazine but could not confirm the specific poem  

### Barriers and challenges
- Some items only had limited preview access due to copyright  
- Inconsistent or unclear metadata made issues harder to identify  
- Searching for poetry using OCR was unreliable  
- Browsing entire issues was time-consuming

## Examining OCR Quality

### Searchability
- HathiTrust allows searching for words and phrases within documents  
- However, search results were often incomplete or inaccurate  

### OCR accuracy
- OCR text often did not match the scanned page exactly  
- Line breaks and formatting in poems were frequently incorrect  
- Decorative or older fonts caused misread letters and words  

### Common OCR errors noticed
- Missing punctuation  
- Merged or split words  
- Incorrect line spacing and indentation  
- Skipped or partially read lines  

### Impact on research
- Makes keyword searching unreliable  
- Researchers could miss poems or specific passages  
- Highlights the need for human correction and curated datasets

## Understanding Context

### Additional context from original pages
- Surrounding articles, advertisements, and editorials  
- Placement of the poem within the issue  
- Visual layout and design choices  

### What else appeared alongside the poem
- Other poems or literary works  
- Political or cultural commentary  
- Advertisements and announcements  

### Information lost in the dataset
- Page layout and visual design  
- Social and historical context of surrounding content  
- Material aspects of the magazine  

### Information gained in the dataset
- Structured and searchable text  
- Consistent metadata (author, publication, year)  
- Easier comparison across time and publications

## Metadata and Organization

### Metadata provided by HathiTrust
- Title  
- Author(s)  
- Publication date  
- Publisher

- Subject headings  

### Comparison to MARC records

### Other data that could have been collected
- OCR accuracy or confidence levels  
- Page numbers for poems  
- Editorial or digitization notes  

### Would we organize the dataset differently?
- Possibly include page images alongside text  
- Add metadata about OCR quality  
- Document editorial decisions more clearly
