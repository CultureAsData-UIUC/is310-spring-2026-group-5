Comment: I tested the Copyleaks press release using their own AI Detector, and the system classified the text as 100% AI-generated.

## Digital Objects & Representations
- Digital objects include datasets and reports that track AI use and plagiarism in student work.  

## Digitization Processes
- Most data is typically born-digital, created entirely online from student submissions.  

## Historical Equivalents
- Before digital tools, teachers manually checked printed essays for plagiarism.  
- Records were kept in physical files, which was slower and less consistent than digital systems.  

## Born-Digital Materials
- AI detection reports, plagiarism scores, and research datasets are all born-digital.  
- They were never physical and rely on algorithms and machine learning, not scanning.  

## Oldest Digital Library or Archive
- Turnitin is one of the earliest digital systems for academic integrity, starting in the late 1990s.  
- It stores student submissions and checks for plagiarism, now also including AI detection features.  
 

## Viral Examples
- AI and plagiarism detection became a hot topic after it showed big increases in AI-generated student work.  
- This led to debates online about fairness, accuracy, and school policies.  

## Free vs. Proprietary Access
- Turnitinis proprietary and require institutional accounts, focusing on enforcement rather than public access.
- Copyleaks also operates as a proprietary system, though it provides public-facing tools for testing AI detection, as done as above.
