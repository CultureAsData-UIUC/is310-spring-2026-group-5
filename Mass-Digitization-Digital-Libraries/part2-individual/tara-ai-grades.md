# Part 2: AI Impact on Student Performance

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushnarwade/ai-impact-on-student-performance

## Digital Objects & Representations
- The main digital object is the Kaggle dataset about AI and student performance
- It represents student grades, study habits, and AI tool usage in data form
- Charts, tables, and analyses created from the dataset are also digital objects

## Digitization Processes
- The data is digital and collected electronically
- Information likely comes from online surveys or digital academic records
- Unlike HathiTrust, there is no scanning or OCR involved.
- Data is cleaned, organized, and stored directly in spreadsheet format

## Historical Equivalents
- Before digital data, student performance was recorded on paper exams and grade books
- Teachers manually tracked grades and study behaviors
- Digital datasets allow faster analysis and larger comparisons than paper records

## Born-Digital Materials
- The dataset is entirely born digital
- Student responses and performance metrics never existed in physical form
- This is different from digitized books, which start as physical objects

## Oldest Digital Library or Archive
- Early digital archives include old school grading systems and academic databases
- These systems stored student performance digitally, but they were not publicly accessible
- Eventually helped establish modern digital record keeping in education

## Newest Digital Library or Archive
- Kaggle is a newer platform for sharing datasets
- It allows public access, downloads, and updates
- Metadata is simple to analyze and is focused on variable descriptions

## Viral Examples
- Discussions about AI affecting student performance often go viral online
- Datasets like this gain attention due to increased debates about AI in education
- Viral attention increases interest and reuse of the dataset

## Free vs. Proprietary Access
- The Kaggle dataset is free and open to the public
- Private educational platforms restrict access to student data
- Free datasets support transparency, private systems focus on control
