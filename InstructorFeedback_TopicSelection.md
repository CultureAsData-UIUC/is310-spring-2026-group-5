# Instructor Feedback on Group & Individual Topic Selection

## Group Feedback

Your group's theme of AI technology within academic, online, and social spaces as a cultural and social system is timely and relevant to the course. The recognition that AI should be examined not just as a technical tool but as something that shapes learning, communication, productivity, and norms shows sophistication. This is exactly the kind of analytical lens this course wants you to develop.

However, your planning document is still quite preliminary, and I need to push you to be much more specific and conceptually rigorous before you move forward. Right now, your scope is very broad, your individual projects are vaguely defined, and there are several major conceptual and ethical issues that you haven't yet addressed. Let me walk through these:

1. **What Exactly Is "AI" in Your Analysis?**

Your group theme uses "AI" as a catch-all category, but this obscures very different phenomena. Are you studying:

- Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot?
- Machine learning algorithms that power recommendation systems, content moderation, or predictive grading tools?
- AI tutoring systems or adaptive learning platforms?
- AI used for proctoring or plagiarism detection?
- Broader automation and algorithmic decision-making in academic systems?

These are radically different things with different implications. Studying ChatGPT usage patterns tells you something very different from studying algorithmic plagiarism detection or predictive learning systems. You cannot lump all of these together under "AI" and expect coherent analysis. **You need to define what specific AI technologies or systems you're examining.** This should be explicit in each individual project.

2. **What Is the "Cultural" Angle?**

Your theme frames AI as a "cultural and social system," but your individual projects seem designed to measure correlations (grades, productivity, plagiarism trends) rather than analyze cultural meaning. There's a tension here that needs resolution.

Are you studying how is AI discussed, understood, feared, celebrated in academic contexts? What narratives circulate around AI and education? Or how do students actually use AI tools? What are their strategies, concerns, workarounds? Or if AI use affect academic performance, learning, integrity?

These require very different methodologies and data types. Correlating student grades with AI usage is a quantitative analysis of outcomes, not a cultural analysis. Analyzing Reddit discussions of AI is a discourse analysis. Interviewing students about their AI practices is ethnographic. So I think you need to carefully think about what is within the bounds of this course.

Beyond scope and definition, there are several important conceptual problems:

- Several of your projects seem designed to correlate AI usage with outcomes (grades, productivity, academic integrity). But correlation doesn't tell you causation. Students who use AI might have higher grades because they're more tech-savvy, more motivated, or already stronger students, not because AI caused the grade improvement. Conversely, struggling students might use AI more, leading to apparent negative correlation. How will you account for confounding variables? This is a fundamental research design question.
- Furthermore, what counts as "productivity"? How do you measure "learning outcomes"? How do you operationalize "academic integrity"? These concepts are not straightforward to measure, especially if you're relying on self-reported data or institutional metrics that may be inconsistent or biased.
- Many of your projects would require access to sensitive student data (grades, plagiarism reports) or would involve surveying students about their AI use. Have you thought about how you'll obtain this data? As noted in the assignment guidelines, we do not do survey data in this course because it requires IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval. So if you're planning to survey students, you need to rethink that approach.

These are not minor issues—they're fundamental to whether your projects are even feasible.

3. **Engage with Published Scholarship**

There is a growing body of scholarship on AI in education, AI ethics, algorithmic systems in academia, and how students engage with AI tools. I think it would be helpful to engage with this scholarship to start thinking about how to frame your projects and what questions are still open. But I also want to caution you that a lot of this literature is very oriented towards Education and Learning Sciences, which may not be the best fit for the culture as data focus of this course. You should look for work that critically examines AI as a cultural and social phenomenon in academic contexts, rather than just studies of learning outcomes or educational technology.

I will be happy to share relevant scholarship but first I think you need to clarify these earlier conceptual framings. For instance, there's significant work on the history of AI, as well as  on technology in the classroom, so happy to point you in that direction once I have a clearer sense of your specific focus.

Generally, you might look in journals like *New Media & Society*, *Critical Studies in Media Communication*, *AI & Society*, for more relevant research.

4. **Clarify Your Individual Projects**

Your current individual project descriptions are too vague to provide substantive feedback. Your document somewhat assigns projects to people, but I think this needs to be much clearer. Who is responsible for which project? This will help you focus and allow me to give more specific feedback.

Given that your theme emphasizes AI as an "cultural and social systems," I'd encourage you to consider whether a cultural/discourse analysis approach might be more aligned with the course and more feasible.

Rather than trying to access student data and measure outcomes, you might instead analyze:

- **How is AI discussed in academic spaces?** Analyze course syllabi, university statements about AI, student discussions in forums and social media. What narratives emerge? What fears, hopes, or assumptions are expressed?
- **How are institutions responding?** Analyze institutional policies, plagiarism detection tools, AI literacy initiatives. What values do these reveal?

This approach would be more aligned with the course's emphasis on "culture, meaning, and data" and would likely raise fewer ethical and access concerns. Happy to discuss this further if you're interested in shifting your focus in this direction.

I did appreciate the notes on communication and your plan to use individual folders for each member's dataset, which all sounds solid. I actually like your use of Google Docs, since in some ways that gives more detailed data on contributions than git, but I would request you share access to the Google Docs so I can assess contributions from respective group members.

Your project focus on correlating student AI usage with grades could be asking an important question about whether and how AI tools impact academic outcomes. However, there was not much details for me to assess your approach. I would encourage you to clarify what exactly you mean by "AI usage" and "grades," how you will measure these, and how you will account for confounding variables. And more broadly, how does this project fit into the cultural analysis of AI in academic contexts? Are you also analyzing how students talk about AI and grades, or institutional narratives around this issue?

There are serious issues with just looking at usage and grades without context. You need to be very careful about how you interpret any correlations you find, and you need to be clear about the limitations of your data and analysis. This is a common problem in educational research, where many factors influence student outcomes, and isolating the effect of one variable (like AI usage) is extremely difficult. Furthermore, as noted above, there's a massive issue of data access and ethics if you're trying to get institutional data on student grades and AI usage. I have had students previously use some of the UIUC Gray Books to look at grades but those often require quite a bit of work to clean up the data and they don't have any data on AI usage, so you would need to find another way to get that data, which is a major challenge.

You might want to consider reframing this project to focus more on the cultural and social aspects of AI usage rather than trying to measure outcomes. For instance, you could analyze how students discuss the relationship between AI and grades in online forums, or how instructors talk about AI in their syllabi and course policies. This would give you insight into the cultural meanings and narratives around AI and academic performance without the data access and ethics issues. I also think you might consider looking at media coverage of AI and grades, or institutional statements about AI and academic performance. This would allow you to analyze the cultural discourse around this issue rather than trying to measure it directly.

Happy to discuss further, but generally I would encourage you to look closely at the assignment description and think about whether you will be creating data from scratch or looking to verify and augment existing data, and also how you will consider scale.

Your interest in examining AI discussions in social spaces is valuable, but I'm confused by the resource link (archived Facebook from 2003), which seems disconnected from contemporary AI and academic contexts. So first it would be helpful to clarify your focus. You do not necessarily need to focus on AI, perhaps it is more digital academic spaces more broadly, but regardless you need to clarify significantly more about what you're studying, how you're studying it, and what questions you're asking. Right now, your project description is very vague and doesn't give me much to work with.

The Individual Ideas section mentions:

- **AI in Social Spaces & Social Media**  
  Dataset drawn from Reddit threads, Twitter/X posts, or other online forums discussing AI in academic or social contexts.

And I'm assuming that this is the project you're proposing, but it's not clear from your document. So again a first question is how does that earlier Facebook link relate to this project? Are you interested in the history of social media and how AI discussions have evolved over time? Or are you focused on contemporary discussions of AI in social media? These are very different projects. I do think looking at historic discussions, or lack thereof, about AI in early social media could be interesting, but it would need to be framed much more clearly as a historical analysis of the emergence of AI discourse in social media. If you're focused on contemporary discussions, then you need to clarify which platforms and communities you're analyzing, what kinds of discussions you're looking at, and what questions you're asking about those discussions. Also again, you'll need to define what you mean by AI in this context. Are you looking at discussions about ChatGPT specifically? Or more broadly about AI tools in education? Or even broader about AI in society? The more specific you can be, the better.

I do think the social media focus would let you potentially do some web scraping, which would help you get some data to start exploring but again that requires confronting platform limitations and quirks. I would suggest you start narrowing and deepening your focus to make this more manageable and meaningful. Happy to discuss further!

Your focus on how AI tools impact student productivity and learning is important, but you face significant challenges in both in conceptualization and data access. You need to clarify what you mean by these concepts and how you'll actually measure them. What counts as "productivity"? What counts as "learning outcomes"? But more broadly, what do these tell us about cultural and social systems around AI in academic contexts? Are you also analyzing how students talk about AI and productivity/learning, or institutional narratives around this issue? You mention "time management" and "perceived learning outcomes" but these are incredibly vague and subjective concepts. I am particularly concerned that you might be considering survey data to measure these, which is not allowed in this course due to IRB requirements. So you need to think about how you will get data on these concepts without surveying students.

One angle would be of course datafying yourself. How do you use AI tools in your own studying? What do you perceive as the impact on your productivity and learning? This would be a self-reflective case study, which could be interesting, but it would need to be framed carefully and thoughtfully. I have mentioned to some of your group mates the idea of analyzing how students discuss the relationship between AI and productivity/learning in online forums, or how instructors talk about AI in their syllabi and course policies, so that might be another angle for you to explore. This would give you insight into the cultural meanings and narratives around AI and academic performance without the data access and ethics issues. Another angle might be trying to look at how AI is marketed to students as a productivity tool. What sorts of promises are made by companies for instance, and how do these reflect assumptions about students or how they learn? For this approach, you might scrape marketing materials, websites, and advertisements for AI tools targeted at students or ones with educational discounts. You could also use the Wayback Machine to look at how these marketing materials have evolved over time. But these are all simply suggestions and it is up to you to decide how you want to approach this.

Generally, I would encourage to return to the assignment description and think about how you will be creating data from scratch or verifying and augmenting existing data, and also how you will consider scale when it comes to these topics. Happy to discuss further!

### Zohra

Your interest in examining plagiarism and academic integrity in relation to AI is timely and important. However, you need to clarify whether you're studying actual plagiarism/cheating behavior, institutional responses, or how these issues are discussed–—because these require very different approaches. In particular, what data will you be using? You write about "plagiarism trends" but which ones exactly? I am not sure there is much data on university honor code violations privately, but you might look at news coverage of this topic. There's been a number of high profile cases of students being accused of AI plagiarism, and these have generated a lot of media coverage. You could analyze this coverage to understand how AI plagiarism is being framed in the media, what narratives are emerging, and what concerns are being expressed. Alternatively/additionally, you could also look at the reaction to these debates over plagiarism in social media forums like Reddit. You might compare student versus professor reactions to AI plagiarism concerns. You could also analyze institutional responses to AI plagiarism, such as university policies, plagiarism detection tools, and academic integrity statements. What do these reveal about institutional values and concerns around AI and academic integrity? This would be a cultural/policy analysis that you can do without accessing sensitive student data.

All of these angles are promising, but obviously require you to decide. I would highly recommend thinking carefully about the politics of "plagiarism" and "academic integrity" as concepts. Both have become particularly sensitive and contested in the context of AI, and there are many different perspectives on what counts as plagiarism, what counts as academic integrity, and how AI tools fit into these concepts. You should be careful not to assume that there's a single, objective definition of these concepts, but rather that they are socially constructed and contested. For instance, plagiarism looks very different for coding versus writing, so approaching this contextually is key.

Also you need to think about what data is feasible within the realm of this course. You cannot do survey data, and you likely cannot access institutional data on plagiarism cases due to privacy and ethics concerns. So you need to think about what public data sources you can use to study this topic. News articles, social media discussions, university policy documents, and marketing materials for plagiarism detection tools are all potential sources of data that you could analyze. But there maybe other sources as well, so I would encourage you to think creatively about where you can find data on this topic. You might also consider doing a literature review of existing research on AI and academic integrity to see what questions have already been explored and what gaps exist in the research that you could fill with your project. Overall, I think this is a promising topic, but you need to clarify your focus and approach significantly before you can move forward. Happy to discuss further!
